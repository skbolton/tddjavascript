# TDD JavaScript
I have been reading a lot of different JavaScript books lately and really soaking up a lot of knowledge. One of the topics that keeps showing up in my studies has been automation of tasks and test running. I have always felt like testing is something that I need to dive into. But I haven't been able to find any support on learning to test.
Thats where this book comes in. It is highly reviewed and seems to go over all of the things I need to know. I will be coding along with the book to cement the learning and updating this readme with my reflections on what I have learned through the text.
## Chapter 1 - Automated testing
* Unit testing - tests a piece of production code by setting one or a few more objects in a know state, exercising them (calling them), and then inspecting the result, comparing it to the expected outcome.
Unit Tests should be stored on disk and easy to run to make them easier to work with.
* Assertion - The heart of a unit test. It states the programmers intended state of a system.
* Test Cases - groups of tests that break down something into individual tasks.

### Reflections
What I like about this chapter is that you build up a testing framework from scratch. A lot of the logic is foreign to me though. It kinda reminds me of secrets of a javascript ninja by John Resig, but just a little simpler. Which is a good thing I guess. All in all I think this will be a good book for me to get through, but it will be challenging.
