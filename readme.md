# TDD JavaScript
I have been reading a lot of different JavaScript books lately and really soaking up a lot of knowledge. One of the topics that keeps showing up in my studies has been automation of tasks and test running. I have always felt like testing is something that I need to dive into. But I haven't been able to find any support on learning to test.
Thats where this book comes in. It is highly reviewed and seems to go over all of the things I need to know. I will be coding along with the book to cement the learning and updating this readme with my reflections on what I have learned through the text.
## Chapter 1 - Automated testing
* Unit testing - tests a piece of production code by setting one or a few more objects in a know state, exercising them (calling them), and then inspecting the result, comparing it to the expected outcome.
Unit Tests should be stored on disk and easy to run to make them easier to work with.
* Assertion - The heart of a unit test. It states the programmers intended state of a system.
* Test Cases - groups of tests that break down something into individual tasks.

### Reflections
What I like about this chapter is that you build up a testing framework from scratch. A lot of the logic is foreign to me though. It kinda reminds me of secrets of a javascript ninja by John Resig, but just a little simpler. Which is a good thing I guess. All in all I think this will be a good book for me to get through, but it will be challenging.

## Chapter 2 - TDD Process
This chapter seemed the most hard to follow for me. There isn't a lot of code in this chapter more of an overview of TDD and how it used on a large scale project. For me its tough to really follow along because I have never found myself working on a team on a large scale project. I am sure that the knowledge in here is useful and that there will come a time when I can connect with it. But for now this chapter didn't resinate with me at all and I was glad it was over. It did state some obvious things about why TDD is good, but at this point it is all RA RA RA. I am ready to learn how to test better. The next chapter will be where things get interesting I believe.
